## Overview

### The challenge

- I had to build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/


### Screenshot

## My process
### Why did you choose this person?
- I have always admired Rihanna for her unwavering determination in acheiving her dreams, blunt personality, constantly expressing pride in being from Barbados, and not being afraid to be experimental with music and beauty.   
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox properties 
### What did you learn from this project?
At first, I used regular CSS, per FreeCodeCamp's directions to user stories like center the figure. However, I wanted to experiment with Flexbox more, so I went with that approach. Through this experience I learned that there's no "one-size-fits-all" method to coding. 

### Code Snippets:

 HTML

Creating a website section
```
<section class="website area">
      <h1 id="section-title"> Discography</h1> 
      <div class="main-container">
        <div class="container"> 
          <h4 class="album-title"> Album 1</h4> 
          <a href="#"  target="_blank"> <img class="album-cover" src="#">
        </div>
        
```

CSS

Styling links
```
/* unvisited link */
  a:link {
	color: red;
  }
 ``` 

### Continued development
- More CSS Flexbox
- Implementing ARIA-Role tags 
- JavaScript 


### Useful resources
- [W3 Schools: CSS Styling Links](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp) - I wanted to find a way to make the links interactive, and this article gave me a few ideas. If you want to do something similiar, I highly recommend this article.   
- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I found this article when I was struggling to implement Flexbox into my CSS file. If you're new to this concept or need a refresher, I highly recommend referring to this guide.
